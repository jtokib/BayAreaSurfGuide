    //Surf spots
    <string name="spot_1">Fort Cronkite-Rodeo Beach, Marin</string>
    <string name="spot_1_desc">Mainly a shortboard spot. Sometimes good, mostly a closeout. It has it\'s days, but those are few and far between. Great spot to take a hike if the surf isn\'t good.</string>
    <string name="spot_1_loc">849VRFJ7+75</string>
    <string name="spot_2">Fort Point, San Francisco</string>
    <string name="spot_2_desc">Novelty spot directly under the Golden Gate Bridge. Best on a low tide with decent sized swell. Take off points shift sometimes moving directly under or even past the bridge with another bowl forming behind a rock that will show on lower tides. Don\’t surf here unless you know what your doing and can handle dirty scowls and people telling you to go home.</string>
    <string name="spot_2_loc">849VRG6F+65</string>
    <string name="spot_3">Secret Spot, San Francisco</string>
    <string name="spot_3_desc">It\'s everyone\'s favorite secret somewhere between Fort Point and Ocean Beach. Don\'t surf here unless you\'re ready to go shoulder-to-shoulder with everyone who hates that you\'re there.</string>
    <string name="spot_3_loc">849VQFQV+6M</string>
    <string name="spot_4">Ocean Beach, San Francisco</string>
    <string name="spot_4_desc">3 miles of beach breaks on the western edge of San Francisco. Not ideal for beginners. Can get world class a few times a year with a large west-northwest swell and light offshore winds from the east. Blown out or small most of spring and summer. Fall and winter is when this spot shines.</string>
    <string name="spot_4_loc">849VQF9P+JR</string>
    <string name="spot_5">Sharp Park Pier, Pacifica</string>
    <string name="spot_5_desc">I\'ve seen some sick barrels here. I\'ve also seen some fins.</string>
    <string name="spot_5_loc">849VJGM3+8G</string>
    <string name="spot_6">Rockaway Beach, Pacifica</string>
    <string name="spot_6_desc">Usually looks better than it actually is. Sometimes fun and usually less crowded than other spots just north or south. </string>
    <string name="spot_6_loc">849VJG52+6P</string>
    <string name="spot_7">Lindamar, Pacifica</string>
    <string name="spot_7_desc">Beginners galore. South end of this cove is a great spot to learn how to surf with one hundred of your new friends. Middle and north end can have punchier shortboard waves. This is the spot to go during winter storms as pre-frontal south winds blow offshore here.</string>
    <string name="spot_7_loc">849VHFXX+H5</string>
    <string name="spot_8">Gray Whale Cove, San Mateo County</string>
    <string name="spot_8_desc">Usually pretty mellow, but the parking lot can get full on the weekend. Not great, but not bad. Fun to change it up type of spot.</string>
    <string name="spot_8_loc">849VHF7P+RC</string>
    <string name="spot_9">Montara Beach, Montara</string>
    <string name="spot_9_desc">More beach break. Crowds aren\'t too bad. Sometimes hollow. South end and middle tend to be where surfers.</string>
    <string name="spot_9_loc">849VGFWP+W5</string>
    <string name="spot_10">Mavericks, Half Moon Bay</string>
    <string name="spot_10_desc">World famous big wave spot. This spot has taken several lives. This is only for experts and pros.</string>
